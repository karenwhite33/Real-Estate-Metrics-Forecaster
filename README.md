# Real-Estate-Metrics-Forecaster
Developed a predictive model using Airbnb listing data to forecast property metrics like size and price. Applied linear and Ridge regression, handled outliers, and optimized model performance with cross-validation to ensure accurate predictions.

PROJECT:

Developed and optimized linear and Ridge regression models using Airbnb listing data (neighborhood, price, size) to predict property metrics and prevent overfitting through cross-validation.
Managed outliers and validated model assumptions (homoscedasticity, linearity) for reliable predictions, using libraries like dplyr, ggplot2, and glmnet.

â˜‘ Predictive Modeling: Built and optimized linear and Ridge regression models to predict property metrics, using Airbnb listing data (neighborhood, price, size, etc.) with multiple libraries.

â˜‘ Model Diagnostics: Managed outliers using Cook's distance; ensured model assumptions (homoscedasticity, linearity) for reliable predictions.

â˜‘ Regularization & Overfitting Prevention: Applied regularization techniques and cross-validation to improve model generalization and prevent overfitting.

â˜‘ Data Splitting & Validation: Ensured robustness with training/test splits and k-fold cross-validation for consistent model performance.

â˜‘ Optimized lambda through cross-validation; evaluated performance with RÂ², RMSE, and MAE on training/test data.

â˜‘ Utilized dplyr, ggplot2, glmnet, caret, reshape2, and stats libraries for efficient data manipulation, visualization, model fitting, regularization, and performance evaluation.
